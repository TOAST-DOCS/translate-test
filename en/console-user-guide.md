<a id="pipeline.node.transform.classify"></a>
##### Classify { #pipeline.node.transform.classify }

Classifies text column values into categories using an LLM. The category list used as the classification criteria must be prepared as a separate data source node.

When the pipeline runs, input data rows are grouped into batches, and the LLM is called once per batch. Each call's prompt includes the category list and the rows in that batch. The LLM returns an appropriate category ID for each row, and the result is stored in the classification result column.

**LLM Settings**
