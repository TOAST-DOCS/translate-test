        * Each flow can define only one Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
        * Connection that fits the category by respective type of node must be defined in order to be saved.
        * A node can have multiple connections.
            * If there are multiple input connections, messages from each connection are processed as single Flow.
            * If there are multiple output connections, it replicates messages that the node outputs to all connections to create a flow.
