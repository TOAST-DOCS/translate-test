## Security > DDoS Guard > L7 DDoS Security Configuration Guide { #security-ddos-guard-l7-ddos-security-configuration-guide }

This document describes security configuration methods to effectively respond to L7 DDoS attacks.

<a id="background"></a>
## 1. Background { #background }

* Increasing L7 Slow DDoS attacks
    * Attacks such as Slowloris and Slow Read, which occupy application-layer sessions for extended periods rather than consuming network bandwidth, occur frequently.
    * Even with low overall traffic volume, these attacks rapidly exhaust the Connection/Session resources of web servers, blocking access for legitimate users.
* Increasing detection difficulty
    * Because these attacks are disguised as normal HTTP requests within HTTPS-encrypted traffic, simple L3/L4 threshold-based anti-DDoS devices alone have limitations in responding to them.

<a id="purpose"></a>
## 2. Purpose { #purpose }

* Establish a comprehensive defense framework
    * Establish multi-layer security policies covering the server, network, and application layers.
* Mitigate web server resource exhaustion
    * Protect server resources during session-based attacks by configuring connection limits and wait time settings.
* Ensure service availability
    * Maintain normal service through appropriate session duration and maximum connection management.

<a id="security-measures"></a>
## 3. Security Measures { #security-measures }

* Web server hardening
    * Minimize resource occupancy caused by abnormal connections by optimizing session settings such as KeepAliveTimeout, RequestReadTimeout, and client_body_timeout.
* Country-based pre-blocking with anti-DDoS solutions
    * Blocking criteria: Apply when web service delays or failures (inaccessibility) occur due to L7 DDoS attacks.
    * Country criteria: In the event of an emergency, block all overseas source IP ranges except for domestic and major service countries (e.g., Korea, Japan).
    * Recovery procedure: After confirming that attack traffic has decreased and the situation has ended, remove the country blocking policy to restore normal service.
