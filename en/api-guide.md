<a id="auth.common"></a>
## Authentication and Common Information { #auth.common }

<a id="auth.common.preparation"></a>
### Prerequisites { #auth.common.preparation }

To use the APIs, you need an **Appkey** and an **authentication token**.

- You can find the Appkey in the **URL & Appkey** menu at the top of the **Machine Learning > NHN Cloud Foundry** page in the NHN Cloud console.
- The APIs use the **gateway-public** endpoint.
- For information on issuing an authentication token (Bearer token in the `X-NHN-Authorization` header), see the [User Access Key Token](https://docs.nhncloud.com/ko/nhncloud/ko/public-api/user-access-key-token/) guide.

<a id="ingest.api"></a>
## Ingest API { #ingest.api }

The Ingest API loads data into a data source that you have already created in the console. It provides a snapshot upload method that replaces all data in the data source with the uploaded file.

!!! danger "Caution"
    An API for creating new data sources is not provided. To use the Ingest API, you must first create a data source in the console, and only FILE type data sources can be used.

<a id="ingest.snapshot"></a>
### Snapshot Upload (File Upload) { #ingest.snapshot }

**Replaces all** data in the data source with the contents of the uploaded file. The upload process consists of three steps.

!!! danger "Caution"
    Snapshot upload replaces all data already loaded in the data source. Existing data cannot be recovered.

Upload limits:

- Maximum upload size: **10 GB**
- `100MB` or less → **Single Upload (SINGLE)**
- More than `100MB` → **Multipart Upload (MULTIPART)**
- Use the `formPost` field values **exactly as returned** in the response.

<a id="ingest.snapshot.init"></a>
#### 1. Upload Initialization (init) { #ingest.snapshot.init }

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/snapshots/init |

Issues a signed temporary URL for uploading large files directly to storage. Returns a single URL (SINGLE) or multipart URLs (MULTIPART) depending on the file size.

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/snapshots/init" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fileName": "data.csv",
    "fileSize": 52428800,
    "contentType": "text/csv"
  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fileName | String | O | File name. Allowed characters: letters, numbers, period (.), underscore (_), hyphen (-) |
| fileSize | Long | O | File size (bytes). Minimum 1, maximum 10 GB |
| contentType | String | X | Content-Type (default: application/octet-stream) |

Response example (SINGLE):

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {
    "jobId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "uploadType": "SINGLE",
    "uploadUrl": "{upload-url}",
    "uploadId": null,
    "partSize": null,
    "parts": null,
    "expiresAt": "2025-01-20T11:00:00Z",
    "formPost": {
      "objectPrefix": "{appKey}/{dataSourceId}/snapshot/{jobId}/",
      "signature": "{SIGNATURE}",
      "expires": 1737370800,
      "maxFileSize": 10737418240,
      "maxFileCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Response example (MULTIPART):

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {
    "jobId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "uploadType": "MULTIPART",
    "uploadUrl": null,
    "uploadId": "{appKey}/{dataSourceId}/snapshot/{jobId}/data.csv_segments/",
    "partSize": 104857600,
    "parts": [
      {
        "partNumber": 1,
        "uploadUrl": "{part-upload-url}?signature={SIG}&expires={TS}&max_file_size=104857600&max_file_count=1",
        "headUrl": "{part-head-url}?temp_url_sig={SIG}&temp_url_expires={TS}"
      }
    ],
    "expiresAt": "2025-01-20T11:00:00Z",
    "formPost": {
      "objectPrefix": "{appKey}/{dataSourceId}/snapshot/{jobId}/",
      "signature": "{SIGNATURE}",
      "expires": 1737370800,
      "maxFileSize": 104857600,
      "maxFileCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

!!! tip "Note"
    The MULTIPART response also includes `formPost`. However, since multipart uploads transmit parts using the query parameters (`signature`/`expires`/`max_file_size`/`max_file_count`) from `parts[].uploadUrl`, `formPost` is for reference only and is not used for the actual part uploads.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| body.jobId | Job ID. Used in subsequent complete/status query requests. |
| body.uploadType | Upload type. SINGLE (100 MB or less) or MULTIPART (more than 100 MB) |
| body.uploadUrl | Upload URL (for single upload) |
| body.uploadId | Multipart upload ID (for multipart upload) |
| body.partSize | Part size (bytes, for multipart upload) |
| body.parts[].partNumber | Part number (starting from 1) |
| body.parts[].uploadUrl | Part upload URL |
| body.parts[].headUrl | URL for retrieving ETag (HEAD request after upload completes) |
| body.expiresAt | URL expiration time |
| body.formPost.objectPrefix | Object prefix (path prepended to the file name) |
| body.formPost.signature | HMAC-SHA1 signature |
| body.formPost.expires | Expiration time (UNIX timestamp) |
| body.formPost.maxFileSize | Maximum file size (bytes) |
| body.formPost.maxFileCount | Maximum file count |

<a id="ingest.snapshot.upload.single"></a>
#### 2-A. Single File Upload (100 MB or Less) { #ingest.snapshot.upload.single }

Send a multipart/form-data POST request to the `uploadUrl` from the init response.
This request is sent directly to Object Storage, so no separate authentication is required (the `signature` serves as authentication).

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "{uploadUrl}" \
  -F "redirect=" \
  -F "max_file_size={formPost.maxFileSize}" \
  -F "max_file_count={formPost.maxFileCount}" \
  -F "expires={formPost.expires}" \
  -F "signature={formPost.signature}" \
  -F "file=@./data.csv;filename=data.csv"
```

!!! danger "Caution"
    The `file` field must be added **last** in the form data. On success, you will receive an HTTP `201 Created` response.

<a id="ingest.snapshot.upload.multipart"></a>
#### 2-B. Large File Upload (More than 100 MB, MULTIPART) { #ingest.snapshot.upload.multipart }

Receive the `parts[]` array from the response and upload each part individually.
Each part is processed in the following order: **(1) upload → (2) retrieve ETag with HEAD request → (3) collect into `partETags[]` in ascending `partNumber` order**.

1. Split the file into chunks of `partSize` (default 100 MB).
2. For each part, parse the query parameters (`signature`, `expires`, `max_file_size`, `max_file_count`) from `parts[i].uploadUrl` and send as multipart/form-data (field name `file`, fixed file name `part`).
3. After a successful upload, send a `HEAD` request to `parts[i].headUrl` to collect the `ETag` value from the response header.
4. When all parts are complete, assemble the `partETags` array in ascending `partNumber` order and include it in the upload complete request.

curl example for part upload:

```bash
# 1) Upload
curl -X POST "{parts[i].uploadUrl}" \
  -F "redirect=" \
  -F "max_file_size={max_file_size-from-query}" \
  -F "max_file_count={max_file_count-from-query}" \
  -F "expires={expires-from-query}" \
  -F "signature={signature-from-query}" \
  -F "file=@./part_i.bin;filename=part"

# 2) Retrieve ETag
curl -I "{parts[i].headUrl}" | grep -i '^etag:'
```

<a id="ingest.snapshot.complete"></a>
#### 3. Upload Complete (complete) { #ingest.snapshot.complete }

    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  }
}
```

!!! tip "Note"
    - A successful response (200) indicates that the collection pipeline has received the event, but does not guarantee that the data has been loaded into the analytics table.
    - It may take up to 10 minutes for data to be loaded into the dataset after an event API request.
    - Retrying after a timeout may result in duplicate entries of the same event. Consider deduplication when analyzing the data.
