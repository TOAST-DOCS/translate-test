## Machine Learning > NHN Cloud Foundry > API Guide { #foundry-api-guide }

Describes the APIs provided by NHN Cloud Foundry.

| API | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ingest API | Collects data into an already created data source. Provides snapshot file upload, event collection, and indicator collection. |
| Recommendation Query API | Requests recommendation results from a recommendation system app. |
| Recommendation Event API | Collects user reaction events to recommendation results. |

<a id="auth-common"></a>
## Authentication and Common Information { #auth-common }

<a id="auth-common-preparation"></a>
### Prerequisites { #auth-common-preparation }

To use the APIs, you need an **Appkey** and an **authentication token**.

- You can find the Appkey in the **URL & Appkey** menu at the top of the **Machine Learning > NHN Cloud Foundry** page in the NHN Cloud console.
- The APIs use the **gateway-public** endpoint.
- For information on issuing an authentication token (Bearer token in the `X-NHN-Authorization` header), see the [User Access Key Token](/nhncloud/en/public-api/user-access-key-token/) guide.

<a id="auth-common-request"></a>
### Common Request Information { #auth-common-request }

Required headers:

```plaintext
X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}
X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Base URL:

```plaintext
https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0
```

<a id="auth-common-response"></a>
### Common Response Information { #auth-common-response }

All API responses consist of a `header` and a `body`.

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {}
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| header.isSuccessful | Boolean | Whether the request succeeded |
| header.resultCode | Integer | Result code. 0 for success; error code for failure. |
| header.resultMessage | String | Result message. SUCCESS for success; error details for failure. |
| body | Object/Array | Response data for each API |

Even if a request is rejected, the HTTP status code may be returned as `200`. Whether the request was successful is determined not by the HTTP status code, but by `header.isSuccessful` and `header.resultCode`. If the authentication token is missing or expired, HTTP `401` is returned.

<a id="ingest-api"></a>
## Ingest API { #ingest-api }

Ingest API is an API for loading data into a data source that you have already created in the console. The following methods are provided depending on the data source type.

| Method | Target Data Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload Snapshot | File | Replace all data with the uploaded file |
| Event Collection | File | Add change events one by one while retaining existing data |
| Metric Collection | Prometheus API | Sends metric (time-series) data in real time |

!!! danger "Caution"
    An API for creating new data sources is not provided. To use the Ingest API, you must first create a data source in the console.

<a id="ingest-snapshot"></a>
### Snapshot Upload (File Upload) { #ingest-snapshot }

**Replaces all** data in the data source with the contents of the uploaded file. The upload process consists of three steps.

!!! danger "Caution"
    Snapshot upload replaces all data already loaded in the data source. Existing data cannot be recovered.

Upload limits:

- Maximum upload size: **10 GB**
- `100MB` or less → **Single Upload (SINGLE)**
- More than `100MB` → **Multipart Upload (MULTIPART)**
- Use the `formPost` field values **exactly as returned** in the response.

<a id="ingest-snapshot-init"></a>
#### 1. Upload Initialization (init) { #ingest-snapshot-init }

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/snapshots/init |

Issues a signed temporary URL for uploading large files directly to storage. Returns a single URL (SINGLE) or multipart URLs (MULTIPART) depending on the file size.

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/snapshots/init" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fileName": "data.csv",
    "fileSize": 52428800,
    "contentType": "text/csv"
  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fileName | String | O | File name. Allowed characters: letters, numbers, period (.), underscore (_), hyphen (-) |
| fileSize | Long | O | File size (bytes). Minimum 1, maximum 10 GB |
| contentType | String | X | Content-Type (default: application/octet-stream) |

Response example (SINGLE):

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {
    "jobId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "uploadType": "SINGLE",
    "uploadUrl": "{upload-url}",
    "uploadId": null,
    "partSize": null,
    "parts": null,
    "expiresAt": "2025-01-20T11:00:00Z",
    "formPost": {
      "objectPrefix": "{appKey}/{dataSourceId}/snapshot/{jobId}/",
      "signature": "{SIGNATURE}",
      "expires": 1737370800,
      "maxFileSize": 10737418240,
      "maxFileCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Response example (MULTIPART):

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {
    "jobId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "uploadType": "MULTIPART",
    "uploadUrl": null,
    "uploadId": "{appKey}/{dataSourceId}/snapshot/{jobId}/data.csv_segments/",
    "partSize": 104857600,
    "parts": [
      {
        "partNumber": 1,
        "uploadUrl": "{part-upload-url}?signature={SIG}&expires={TS}&max_file_size=104857600&max_file_count=1",
        "headUrl": "{part-head-url}?temp_url_sig={SIG}&temp_url_expires={TS}"
      }
    ],
    "expiresAt": "2025-01-20T11:00:00Z",
    "formPost": {
      "objectPrefix": "{appKey}/{dataSourceId}/snapshot/{jobId}/",
      "signature": "{SIGNATURE}",
      "expires": 1737370800,
      "maxFileSize": 104857600,
      "maxFileCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

!!! tip "Note"
    The MULTIPART response also includes `formPost`. However, since multipart uploads transmit parts using the query parameters (`signature`/`expires`/`max_file_size`/`max_file_count`) from `parts[].uploadUrl`, `formPost` is for reference only and is not used for the actual part uploads.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| body.jobId | Job ID. Used in subsequent complete/status query requests. |
| body.uploadType | Upload type. SINGLE (100 MB or less) or MULTIPART (more than 100 MB) |
| body.uploadUrl | Upload URL (for single upload) |
| body.uploadId | Multipart upload ID (for multipart upload) |
| body.partSize | Part size (bytes, for multipart upload) |
| body.parts[].partNumber | Part number (starting from 1) |
| body.parts[].uploadUrl | Part upload URL |
| body.parts[].headUrl | URL for retrieving ETag (HEAD request after upload completes) |
| body.expiresAt | URL expiration time |
| body.formPost.objectPrefix | Object prefix (path prepended to the file name) |
| body.formPost.signature | HMAC-SHA1 signature |
| body.formPost.expires | Expiration time (UNIX timestamp) |
| body.formPost.maxFileSize | Maximum file size (bytes) |
| body.formPost.maxFileCount | Maximum file count |

<a id="ingest-snapshot-upload-single"></a>
#### 2-A. Single File Upload (100 MB or Less) { #ingest-snapshot-upload-single }

Send a multipart/form-data POST request to the `uploadUrl` from the init response.
This request is sent directly to Object Storage, so no separate authentication is required (the `signature` serves as authentication).

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "{uploadUrl}" \
  -F "redirect=" \
  -F "max_file_size={formPost.maxFileSize}" \
  -F "max_file_count={formPost.maxFileCount}" \
  -F "expires={formPost.expires}" \
  -F "signature={formPost.signature}" \
  -F "file=@./data.csv;filename=data.csv"
```

!!! danger "Caution"
    The `file` field must be added **last** in the form data. On success, you will receive an HTTP `201 Created` response.

<a id="ingest-snapshot-upload-multipart"></a>
#### 2-B. Large File Upload (More than 100 MB, MULTIPART) { #ingest-snapshot-upload-multipart }

Receive the `parts[]` array from the response and upload each part individually.
Each part is processed in the following order: **(1) upload → (2) retrieve ETag with HEAD request → (3) collect into `partETags[]` in ascending `partNumber` order**.

1. Split the file into chunks of `partSize` (default 100 MB).
2. For each part, parse the query parameters (`signature`, `expires`, `max_file_size`, `max_file_count`) from `parts[i].uploadUrl` and send as multipart/form-data (field name `file`, fixed file name `part`).
3. After a successful upload, send a `HEAD` request to `parts[i].headUrl` to collect the `ETag` value from the response header.
4. When all parts are complete, assemble the `partETags` array in ascending `partNumber` order and include it in the upload complete request.

curl example for part upload:

```bash
# 1) Upload
curl -X POST "{parts[i].uploadUrl}" \
  -F "redirect=" \
  -F "max_file_size={max_file_size-from-query}" \
  -F "max_file_count={max_file_count-from-query}" \
  -F "expires={expires-from-query}" \
  -F "signature={signature-from-query}" \
  -F "file=@./part_i.bin;filename=part"

# 2) Retrieve ETag
curl -I "{parts[i].headUrl}" | grep -i '^etag:'
```

<a id="ingest-snapshot-complete"></a>

<a id="event-ingest-api"></a>
### Ingest Events { #event-ingest-api }

Sends change events while retaining existing data. This is used with data sources of the file type, and you must first enable the **Event API**. You can enable it from the event settings tab in the console or by using the activation API below.

!!! danger "Caution"
    Enabling the Event API blocks snapshot uploads. In addition, schema changes are restricted, so you must disable the Event API before making any schema changes. For instructions on how to enable and disable it, see "Event Settings" in the [Console User Guide](./console-user-guide/#datasource-detail-event).

<a id="event-ingest-api-enable"></a>
#### Enable/Disable Event API { #event-ingest-api-enable }

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/events/enable |
| POST | /api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/events/disable |

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/events/enable" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

Response example:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {
    "enabled": false,
    "status": "ENABLING"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| body.enabled | Whether event collection is available |
| body.status | Activation status. DISABLED, ENABLING, ENABLED, ENABLE_FAILED |

- Activation is processed asynchronously. Immediately after the request, the response shows `enabled` as false and `status` as ENABLING. Events are collected after the status becomes ENABLED.
- If you request activation again while activation is in progress, the request is rejected. You can check the progress on the Event Settings tab in the console.

<a id="event-ingest-api-send"></a>
#### Send a Single Event { #event-ingest-api-send }

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/events |

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/events" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \

  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| operation | String | O | Operation type. One of INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE |
| data | Object | O | Event data. Uses the field names of the data source schema as keys |
| eventTimestamp | String | X | Timestamp of the event. If omitted, the server's received time is used |

- `operation` is case-insensitive. If you send a value that is not allowed, the request will be rejected.
- If no primary key field is specified for the data source, only `INSERT` can be sent. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` will be rejected. A data source with a primary key specified can use all three operations.

Response example:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "body": {

<a id="metrics-ingest-api"></a>
### Metric Collection { #metrics-ingest-api }

Sends metric data to a data source of the Prometheus API type. The sent metrics can be viewed in the Analysis menu and can also be used as input for the univariate time-series anomaly detection app.

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/metrics |

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/data-sources/{dataSourceId}/ingest/metrics" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metrics": [
      {
        "timestamp": 1776149886528,
        "value": 4.99,
        "labels": [
          { "name": "__name__", "value": "cpu_usage" },
          { "name": "instance_id", "value": "instance-001" }
        ],
        "metadata": { "resourceType": "Instance" }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| metrics | Array | O | List of metrics. Cannot be empty; maximum of 5,000 items per request |
| metrics[].timestamp | Long | O | Metric timestamp. Millisecond epoch |
| metrics[].value | Double | O | Measured value |
| metrics[].labels | Array | O | List of labels. The combination of labels determines the time series, and group labels determine the group |
| metrics[].labels[].name | String | O | Label name. Must start with an alphabetic character or _, and can only contain alphabetic characters, numbers, and _ |
| metrics[].labels[].value | String | O | Label value. Commas and equals signs cannot be used |
| metrics[].metadata | Object | X | Additional information. Stored and delivered as-is without interpretation. The identityKey key is reserved for system use and cannot be used |

On success, returns HTTP `202 Accepted`. If the request is rejected, HTTP `200` is returned with `header.isSuccessful` set to `false`, so use `header` to determine whether the request succeeded.

The collection rules are as follows:

- If required fields are missing, label name or value rules are violated, a single request exceeds 5,000 items, or required headers are missing, the entire request is rejected and no items are saved.
- You can include metrics from multiple time series in a single request. Because time series are distinguished by label combinations, you do not need to send a separate request for each time series.
- Send data for the same time series only once per minute. If you collect data at a shorter interval, combine it into a 1-minute average before sending. If multiple values arrive within the same minute, only the first value received is used for analysis, and the rest are discarded.
- `timestamp` is an epoch value in milliseconds. If you send it in seconds, it will be saved as an incorrect time.
- If you have specified a group label in the Data Source, always include that label when sending data. If the label is missing, the data will not belong to the intended group.
- Items where `value` is NaN or Infinity are skipped and not saved. The remaining items in the same request are processed normally.
- A `202` response indicates that the data has been received. The data will be saved after a short delay. If you send the same request again, the same data may be stored in duplicate.
- Data that arrives late is saved, but may be excluded from real-time inference.

!!! tip "Tips"
    Loading is independent of the transmission interval. However, if this data source is connected to a univariate time-series anomaly detection app, you must send the same time series continuously, one per minute without interruption. Because the app groups metrics in 1-minute intervals for evaluation, sending at longer intervals will create gaps, which may prevent preparation from completing in precise mode.

<a id="univariate-api"></a>
## Univariate Time Series Anomaly Detection API { #univariate-api }

<a id="univariate-group-api"></a>
### Enable, Disable, and Delete Groups { #univariate-group-api }

Enables, disables, and deletes groups of a univariate time-series anomaly detection app. The three APIs share the same request format and differ only in their paths.

  -d '{
    "groupKey": [
      { "name": "region", "value": ["kr1", "jp1"] }
    ]
  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| groupKey | Array | Conditional | List of labels that specify the target group. Used only when group labels are specified in the data source. |
| groupKey[].name | String | O | Group label name. Must exactly match the group label name specified in the data source. |
| groupKey[].value | Array | O | List of values for that label. Each value corresponds to one group. |

On success, `header.isSuccessful` returns `true` and there is no `body`.

The request rules are as follows:

- If no group labels are specified in the data source, do not send `groupKey`. The entire data source is treated as a single group and becomes the target. If `groupKey` is included, the request is rejected.
- If group labels are specified in the data source, `groupKey` is required, and the set of label names sent must exactly match the group labels of the data source. Sending the same label name twice is rejected.
- If there are multiple group labels, values at the same position are paired to form a group. For example, if `["a", "b"]` is sent for `rule_id` and `["q", "w"]` for `instance_id`, the two target groups are `(a, q)` and `(b, w)`. All labels must have the same number of values; otherwise, the request is rejected.
- If a value list is empty, the request is rejected. If the same group is specified more than once, it is processed only once.
- Stopping or deleting a group that is not registered returns an error.

!!! tip "Note"
    When metrics arrive, groups are automatically registered and start operating. This API is used to selectively enable, disable, or delete specific groups; this operation is not available in the console. You can check registered groups and their status on the **Group List** tab in the app details in the console.

!!! danger "Warning"
    Disabling a group does not stop the transmission of detection results. Only the status displayed in the group list changes to disabled.
    A deleted group is permanently removed along with its status history and cannot be recovered.

## Recommendation API { #recommendation-api }

Requests recommendation results from the recommendation system app that you created. If the user's interaction history is sufficient, the server performs model-based inference (Sequential); if the history is insufficient, it performs attribute-based inference (Cold Start).

### Request Recommendations { #recommendation-api-recommend }

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/recommendation-apps/{appId}/recommend |

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/recommendation-apps/{appId}/recommend" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user_12345",
    "context": {
      "currentItemKey": "CONT0001",
      "recentlyViewed": ["CONT0010", "CONT0023"],
      "pageType": "course_detail",
      "sessionId": "session_abc123"
    },
    "options": {
      "maxRecommendations": 10
    }
  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userId | String | O | ID of the user to receive recommendations. To request recommendations for an anonymous user, specify an empty string (""). |
| context.currentItemKey | String | X | Key of the item currently being viewed |
| context.recentlyViewed | Array | X | List of recently viewed item keys |
| context.availableItems | Array | X | List of item keys eligible for recommendation. If specified, only items in this list are recommended. |
| context.pageType | String | X | Current page type (free-form; for example: home, item_detail) |
| context.sessionId | String | X | Session ID |
| context.impressions | Array | X | List of items exposed to the user as recommendation results |
| context.interactions | Array | X | Information about actions performed by the user on an item |
| context.feedback | Array | X | Evaluation left by the user on the item |
| userAttributes | Object | X | User attribute information (used for Cold Start inference) |
| options.maxRecommendations | Integer | X | Maximum number of recommendations (from 1 to 100). Values exceeding 100 are adjusted to 100 without an error; if not specified, 100 is applied. If fewer items are available than this value, only the actual number of available items is returned. |
| options.mode | String | X | Specifies the inference mode. One of: sequential (history-based), cold_start (attribute-based), popular (popularity-based). If not specified, the server determines this automatically. |
| options.longtail | Boolean | X | Improves recommendation diversity by including less popular items. Applies only when sequential is used. |
| options.excludeItemKeys | Array | X | List of item keys to exclude from recommendations. Excluded items are not counted toward the maximum number of recommendations. |

- If `options.mode` is not specified, the server determines the inference type. If the app does not have a model for the determined type, the server recommends an alternative type that is integrated with the app instead. The type actually used can be checked in `body.metadata.inferenceType` of the response.
- If the app does not have a model for the requested type and there is no alternative type, HTTP `503` and result code `5030001` are returned. Check which models have been created in the app and whether training has completed, then call again. Requests that specify a type via `options.mode` are not substituted, so you may receive this response.

#### Behavior Signals { #recommendation-api-signal }

`context.impressions` is used to reorder recommendation results based on the recommendation information exposed to the user.
`context.interactions` and `context.feedback` are fields that convey actions the user took on the recommendation results, and reflect user behavior-based data into model inference.

```json
{
  "userId": "user_12345",
  "context": {
    "impressions": [
      {
        "requestId": "req_xyz789",
        "itemKeys": ["CONT0023", "CONT0045"],
        "occurredAt": "2026-08-25T10:00:00+09:00"
      }
    ],
    "interactions": [
      {
        "requestId": "req_xyz789",
        "itemKey": "CONT0023",
        "type": "CLICK",
        "occurredAt": "2026-08-25T10:00:05+09:00"
      }
    ],
    "feedback": [
      {
        "requestId": "req_xyz789",
        "itemKey": "CONT0045",
        "type": "NEGATIVE",
        "occurredAt": "2026-08-25T10:00:10+09:00"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| requestId | String | O | The body.metadata.requestId of the recommendation response in which the action occurred |
| itemKeys | Array | O | List of exposed item keys. Enter in the order of exposure; used in impressions |
| itemKey | String | O | Target item key. Used in interactions and feedback |
| type | String | O | interactions uses CLICK or CONVERSION. feedback uses POSITIVE or NEGATIVE |
| occurredAt | String | O | The time at which the action occurred |

- `occurredAt` must be sent in ISO 8601 format with a timezone offset. Requests without an offset are treated as errors.
- All three fields require `requestId`, `occurredAt`, and an item key to be used as signals.
- Each field must be sent in chronological order, from oldest to most recent.
- `impressions` allows a maximum of 10 entries, with up to 100 `itemKeys` per entry. `interactions` and `feedback` each allow a maximum of 10 entries per `type`. Requests that exceed these limits are rejected.
- Behavior signals are used only as inference input for the current recommendation request and are not stored. If the `feedback` for the same item changes, only the most recent value is reflected, so resend the data with every request to maintain the effect.
- To store reaction events for analysis, use the [Recommendation Event API](#recommendation-event-api) together.

!!! tip "Note"
    The collection method and field types of the `userAttributes` schema may change in the future depending on the implementation direction of Preference Elicitation.

<a id="recommendation-event-api"></a>
## Recommendation Event API { #recommendation-event-api }

Collects user interaction events (such as clicks) in response to recommendation results. You can analyze the recommendation success rate using the collected event data.

<a id="recommendation-event-api-send"></a>
### Send Recommendation Event { #recommendation-event-api-send }

| Method | URI |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1.0/recommendation-apps/{appId}/events |

curl example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://{gateway-public-host}/api/v1.0/recommendation-apps/{appId}/events" \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "CLICK",
    "requestId": "req_xyz789",
    "itemKey": "CONT0023",
    "userId": "user_12345",
    "context": {
      "sessionId": "sess_abc",
      "placement": "home_main"
    }
  }'
```

Pass the values received from the recommendation query API response as-is for `requestId`, `itemKey`, and `userId`.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eventType | O | Event type. Can be defined freely (e.g., CLICK, PURCHASE, IMPRESSION). Only English letters, numbers, and underscores (_) are allowed (^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$), up to 64 characters. Stored in uppercase regardless of the case entered. REQUEST and RESPONSE are reserved words and cannot be used. |
| requestId | O | The body.metadata.requestId value from the recommendation API response (opaque string, up to 128 characters) |
| itemKey | O | The itemKey of the recommended item that the user interacted with |
| userId | X | The body.userId value from the recommendation API response |
| context | X | Additional event information (free-form key-value pairs; e.g., display position, placement) |
| userAttributes | X | User attribute information (free-form key-value pairs) |
| options | X | Additional options (free-form key-value pairs) |

A successful response (200) returns only the `header`.

```json
{
  "header": {
    "isSuccessful": true,
    "resultCode": 0,
    "resultMessage": "SUCCESS"
  }
}
```

!!! tip "Note"
    - A successful response (200) indicates that the collection pipeline has received the event, but does not guarantee that the data has been loaded into the analytics table.
    - It may take up to 10 minutes for data to be loaded into the dataset after an event API request.
    - Retrying after a timeout may result in duplicate entries of the same event. Consider deduplication when analyzing the data.
