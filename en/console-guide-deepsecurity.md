<a id="user-guide-for-image-replication"></a>
### User Guide for Image Replication { #user-guide-for-image-replication }

This guide regards to using vaccines for the creation of private image-based instances, including vaccine agents. 

* Access instance, and install each script by creation or execution. 
* Following the guide to enable vaccine agents, click Refresh and **Start Service** on the service page. 

※ Caution 

* Change Appkey of "group:Appkey" in the script, into that of **URL & Appkey** on the service page. 
* For unwanted replication instances, it is recommended to delete installed agents so as not to waste unnecessary resources.   
* After 'Start Service', the service status immediately enables 'Close Service', but vaccines start to operate in no more than 10 minutes, like the initial installation.  

1\. Agent Script for Linux
