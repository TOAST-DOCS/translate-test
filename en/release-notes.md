    - Data source: Create a data source by defining a schema, and load data via file upload or the Ingest API (snapshot upload) for use in recommendations and analysis.
    - Analysis: Query loaded data and analyze it by visualizing it with charts and dashboards.
    - Pipeline: Transform data from data sources into analyzable datasets using filtering, aggregation, joining, and more, with support for automatic execution on a batch schedule. The transformed datasets can be used for analysis or recommendation model training.
    - App: Create a recommendation system app trained on user, item, and interaction data, and use the recommendation results in your service via the recommendation API.
