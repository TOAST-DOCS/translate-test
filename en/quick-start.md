This document describes the process of creating a **recommendation system app** in NHN Cloud Foundry and using the recommendation results.
After completing the prerequisites (requesting the service and preparing data), follow the steps below:

1. Create a data source
2. Create an app
3. Check the app status
4. Retrieve recommendation results
5. Collect recommendation events

<a id="preparation"></a>
## Prerequisites { #preparation }

<a id="preparation.service.enable"></a>
### Request service { #preparation.service.enable }

NHN Cloud Foundry cannot be enabled directly from the console. To use the service, you must submit a request via [1:1 Inquiry](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/support/inquiry).

1. Select the organization and project where you want to use the service in the NHN Cloud console.
2. On the **Machine Learning > NHN Cloud Foundry > Status** tab, click the **1:1 Inquiry** button, and submit a request including the resource size that you want.
3. Once the person in charge enables the service for the project, all features become available.

<a id="preparation.data"></a>
### Prepare data { #preparation.data }

To create a recommendation system app, you need the following three CSV data files:

| Data | Required columns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User table | User ID | User information (additional attribute columns are optional) |
| Item table | Item ID | Item information (additional attribute columns are optional) |
| History table | User ID, Item ID, Timestamp | User-item interaction history (rating and category columns are optional) |

<a id="datasource.create"></a>
## 1. Create a data source { #datasource.create }

Go to the **Machine Learning > NHN Cloud Foundry > Data Source** tab.
For a detailed description of each setting, see 'Create a data source' in the [Console User Guide](../console-user-guide/#datasource.create).

1. Click the **Create data source** button.

    ![Create data source](../static/images/quick-start/데이터소스생성모달1.png){ height="70%" }

2. Enter the data source name and table name in the basic settings.
3. In the detailed settings, select a CSV file. If the first row of the file contains column names, check **First row is a header**. Enter the primary key field (e.g., `user_id`).
4. Click the **Infer types** button to automatically populate the schema from the CSV sample. Correct any incorrectly inferred types manually.

    ![Create data source - select file and infer types](../static/images/quick-start/데이터소스생성모달2.png){ height="70%" }

5. Click the **Add** button to create the data source.
6. Create the **user, item, and history** data sources in the same way.
7. Wait until the status in the list changes to COMPLETED.

## 2. Create an app { #app.create }

Go to the **Machine Learning > NHN Cloud Foundry > Apps** tab and click the **Create app** button.
For a detailed description of each setting, see 'Create an app' in the [Console User Guide](../console-user-guide/#app.create).

<a id="app.create.basic"></a>
### Basic settings { #app.create.basic }

Enter the app name and description, select **Recommendation system** as the app type, and click **Next**.

![Create app - basic settings](../static/images/quick-start/앱생성화면1.png){ height="70%" }

<a id="app.create.detail"></a>
### Detailed settings { #app.create.detail }

1. Click the **Add model** button to add the model to use. For a new service, we recommend the **Cold User** model; if you have sufficient user behavior history, use **Warm User (Transformer)**.

    ![Create app - model settings](../static/images/quick-start/앱생성화면2.png){ height="70%" }

2. In **Data connection settings** on the model card, select the user, item, and history data sources that you created in step 1.
   Specify the user ID and item ID columns and the timestamp column in the history. Select feature columns only when needed.

    ![Create app - data connection settings](../static/images/quick-start/앱생성화면3.png){ height="70%" }

3. If necessary, connect skill tables and other resources in **Additional settings (Skills)**. Set the Longtail mode in the basic model settings (this includes items with lower popularity in recommendations). When done, click **Next**.

    ![Create app - additional settings](../static/images/quick-start/앱생성화면4.png){ height="70%" }

<a id="app.create.review"></a>
### Final review { #app.create.review }

1. Review the basic settings, model settings, and additional settings that you entered.
2. Click the **Save** button to create the app.

![Create app - final review](../static/images/quick-start/앱생성화면5.png){ height="70%" }

<a id="app.status"></a>
## 3. Check the app status { #app.status }

After the app is created, training and deployment proceed automatically. The status changes through Initializing, Training, Deploying, and Activating before reaching Active.
Wait until the status in the app list changes to Active.

![App list](../static/images/quick-start/앱목록.png){ height="70%" }

For a detailed description of each status value, see 'App status' in the [Console User Guide](../console-user-guide/#app.list.status).

!!! tip "Note"
    Training and deployment immediately after app creation is the process of preparing the app. The first training of the recommendation model runs at the time specified in the batch schedule settings. Until then, even if the recommendation API returns a response, it does not reflect the recommendations of a trained model.

## 4. Retrieve recommendation results { #recommendation.query }

When the app becomes active, you can check recommendation results on the recommendation API call screen in the console, or retrieve recommendation results by calling the recommendation query API.
For a detailed description of each item, see 'Call recommendation API' in the [Console User Guide](../console-user-guide/#app.detail.recommend).

1. In the app list, click the app that you created to go to the **Call recommendation API** tab on the details screen.
2. Enter the user ID and specify the recommendation mode and maximum number of recommendations.
3. Click the **Request recommendations** button to display the rank, item key, and score in the recommendation results. You can also check the total number of results and the response time.

    ![Call recommendation API](../static/images/quick-start/추천API호출.png){ height="70%" }

**Request preview** displays the actual API request JSON composed of the input values. You can copy it using the **Copy** button and use it for API integration development.
For instructions on directly calling the recommendation query API, see 'Recommendation query API' in the [API Guide](../api-guide/#recommendation.api).

The response includes the request identifier (`metadata.requestId`) and the list of recommended items (`recommendations[].itemKey`). These values are used when sending recommendation events in the next step.

On the **App info** tab, you can check the app ID, status, and version used for API calls.

<a id="recommendation.event"></a>
## 5. Collect recommendation events { #recommendation.event }

When a user interacts with recommendation results, such as clicking on them, send the event data using the recommendation event API. You can analyze the recommendation success rate using the accumulated event data.
For a detailed description of each request field, see 'Recommendation event API' in the [API Guide](../api-guide/#recommendation.event.api).

```bash
curl -X POST '{URL}/api/v1.0/recommendation-apps/{APP_ID}/events' \
  -H "X-NC-APP-KEY: {APP_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-NHN-Authorization: {AUTH_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "CLICK",
    "requestId": "{RecommendApiResponse.body.metadata.requestId}",
    "itemKey": "{RecommendApiResponse.body.recommendations.itemKey}",
    "userId": "{RecommendApiResponse.body.userId}",
    "context": {
      "position": 1,
      "placement": "home_main"
    }
  }'
```

!!! tip "Note"
    After an event API request, it may take up to 10 minutes for the data to be loaded into the dataset.
