### New service launch
* We've launched Private CA service. You can use the Private CA service to create Root CAs and Intermediate CAs to issue certificates for internal use within your organization. Support for the ACME protocol allows you to automatically issue and renew certificates with clients like Certbot. You can also check the status of certificate revocation with the certificate revocation list (CRL) and online certificate status protocol (OCSP).
